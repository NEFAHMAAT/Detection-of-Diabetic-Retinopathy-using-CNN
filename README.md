# Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-CNN
Diabetic retinopathy detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training the model on labeled fundus images to recognize specific patterns indicative of the condition. Once trained, the CNN can analyze new retinal images, automatically identifying signs of diabetic retinopathy and assisting in early diagnosis.
